            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>
                I was born in 1993 and grew up in West Hartford, CT. After highschool, I
                attended the University of Rochester in Upstate NY. I studied Environmental Science and graduated in
                2015. Soon after, I moved to Boston and started working for a start-up company that made charging
                stations for electric vehicles. I worked as a Technical Writer and Team Lead.
            </p>

            <p>
                After five years at this company, I decided to pursue a career in IT. I took a few courses in
                Data Managment and signed up for an apprenticeship program. The program put me through Cybersecurity training and placed me at MIT Lincoln Labs. This past year, I was hired as a full-time Cyber Security Analyst at MITLL. To read more about my work life, please see my <a
