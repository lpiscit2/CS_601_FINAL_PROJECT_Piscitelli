            <h3> Mountain Biking </h3>
            <p>My favorite hobby right now is <b>mountain biking</b>. I started mountain biking when I was 15 on my dad's old hardtail bicycle. I have some great memories of coming home from school and racing outside to get lost in the woods until the setting sun forced me home again. This past year, my father gave me the same bike that I rode all those years ago and I rekindled my passion for riding. This video might not look like much, but getting up rocky climbs is a huge thrill for me.</p>

            <h3> Yoga </h3>
            <p> Another hobby of mine is <b>yoga and meditation</b>. I found meditation (or rather meditation found me) when I was 21 and in the midst of a heart break. I started meditating as a way to lessen the heartache and ended up finding a practice that enriched my entire life.</p>
